SAAS for deploying Wordpress Amazon affiliate websites - built using PHP Codeigniter framework and utilizing API endoints for cPanel as well as custom built scripts for WordPress deployment.

Due to the complexity requirements of this applicaiton it cannot be easily deployed for demo purposes. It requires multiple servers and a vast amount of domains to work in its fully funcitonal state. When fully setup, the main applicaiton is on its own server and requires a large amount of domains to be on standby. When a user signs up they are able to deploy a full functional WordPress affiliate website in a few clicks.

Overview of what this system accomplishes:

-grabs a registered domain and adds it to the appropriate server

-installs WordPress onto the domain

-installs a custom theme built for affiliate sites that promote Amazon products

-installs all required plugins onto the WordPress backend including custom plugins

-populates the website with Amazon affiliate products

-allows the user to order and publish unique content with a few clicks

-gives the user an organized list of all their domains that they can view/access from a front-end portal

-the user is able to see the website URL, login information, as well as order as many sites as they wish to create

In a nutshell this SAAS makes deploying Amazon affiliate sites possible for users with zero experience in web development and affiliate marketing. The idea behind this system was to allow anyone to build a large group of Amazon affiliate websites with no technical skills required so they could earn an extra income online.
